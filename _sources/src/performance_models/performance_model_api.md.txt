# Performance model API

Performance model classes are all Pydantic models derived from
{py:class}`BasePerformanceModel
<AEIC.performance.models.BasePerformanceModel>`. This is an abstract base
class that includes data common to all performance model types (aircraft name
and class, maximum altitude and payload, number of engines, optional APU
information and optional LTO and speed information) and that defines the
performance model API. The legacy table-based performance model is represented
by the {py:class}`LegacyPerformanceModel
<AEIC.performance.models.LegacyPerformanceModel>` class. This includes a
performance table represented by the {py:class}`PerformanceTable
<AEIC.performance.models.legacy.PerformanceTable>` class which performs
subsetting and interpolation within the input data.

## Loading performance models

Performance models can be loaded from TOML files. A top-level `model_type`
string field is used to distinguish between different types of performance
model and a {py:class}`PerformanceModel
<AEIC.performance.models.PerformanceModel>` wrapper class is used to enable
this: there is a {py:meth}`load
<AEIC.performance.models.PerformanceModel.load>` class method with a
polymorphic return type, that takes a path to a TOML file containing a
performance model definition and returns an instance of the correct
performance model class based on the `model_type` field. For the current
legacy-based performance models, use `model_type = "legacy"`.

## Mission-based performance model selection

When simulating trajectories from multiple missions, it will often be the case
the different performance models will be used for different missions,
depending on the aircraft type (and possibly other missions parameters). To
enable this, it is possible to pass a {py:class}`PerformanceModelSelector
<AEIC.performance.model_selector.PerformanceModelSelector>` value instead of
an individual performance model when simulating a trajectory. A performance
model selector is essentially just a function from a {py:class}`Mission
<AEIC.missions.Mission>` to a {py:class}`BasePerformanceModel
<AEIC.performance.models.BasePerformanceModel>` and is called to determine the
performance model to use for each mission.

A simple performance model selector implementation is provided by the
{py:class}`SimplePerformanceModelSelector
<AEIC.performance.model_selector.SimplePerformanceModelSelector>` class. This
class implements a simple mapping from aircraft type to performance model
based on the contents of a directory that holds TOML performance model files
with names based on the aircraft type along with a configuration file that
defines a default performance model and synonyms for aircraft types without
their own performance model files.

## Performance evaluation

The fundamental operation of a performance model is to take an aircraft state,
(represented by a value of the {py:class}`AircraftState
<AEIC.performance.types.AircraftState>` type) and a flight rule (see below)
and to return aircraft performance data (a value of the {py:class}`Performance
<AEIC.performance.types.Performance>` type). This is achieved by calling the
{py:meth}`evaluate <AEIC.performance.models.BasePerformanceModel.evaluate>`
method on a performance model instance.

Aircraft state includes altitude, aircraft mass and optionally a target true
airspeed and/or rate of climb/descent. Some performance models may make use of
the optional values, some may not. The legacy table-based performance model
does not: all return values from the legacy model depend only on aircraft
altitude, aircraft mass and a simple climb/cruise/descent flight rule.

The performance data returned from the {py:meth}`evaluate
<AEIC.performance.models.BasePerformanceModel.evaluate>` method contains
actual achievable true airspeed, actual achievable rate of climb/descent and
fuel flow rate.

Different types of performance model may implement different kinds of
potential flight rules. For example, a performance model might support
specifying that climb and descent phases should be conducted at constant rate
of climb, constant calibrated airspeed, or constant Mach number, and the
cruise phase at constant altitude or constant lift coefficient. The simplest
flight rules, as used by the {py:class}`LegacyPerformanceModel
<AEIC.performance.models.LegacyPerformanceModel>` class, are represented by
the {py:class}`SimpleFlightRules <AEIC.performance.types.SimpleFlightRules>`
class, which simply specifies "climb", "cruise", or "descend".

## Usage example

```python
import tomllib
from AEIC.config import Config, config
from AEIC.performance.models import PerformanceModel, LegacyPerformanceModel
from AEIC.performance.types import AircraftState, SimpleFlightRules
from AEIC.units import FL_TO_METERS

# Load default AEIC configuration.
Config.load()
# Load (table-based legacy) performance model.
model = PerformanceModel.load(
    config.file_location('performance/sample_performance_model.toml')
)
assert isinstance(model, LegacyPerformanceModel)

# Create aircraft state.
state = AircraftState(altitude=350 * FL_TO_METERS, aircraft_mass=70000)

# Evaluate performance model for state and flight rules.
perf = model.evaluate(state, SimpleFlightRules.CLIMB)

print(perf)
# Result:
# Performance(
#     true_airspeed=237.4846304442151,
#     rate_of_climb=33.69675733337415,
#     fuel_flow=1.5102911008506104
# )
```

## Performance model members

After a performance model instance is created (of any type derived from
 {py:class}`BasePerformanceModel
 <AEIC.performance.models.BasePerformanceModel>`), as well as being set up for
 calls to the {py:meth}`evaluate
 <AEIC.performance.models.BasePerformanceModel.evaluate>` method, the instance
 also contains:

- Basic information about the performance model: aircraft name and class,
  number of engines, maximum altitude and payload.
- {py:attr}`lto_performance
  <AEIC.performance.models.BasePerformanceModel.lto_performance>`: modal
  thrust settings, fuel flows, and emission indices taken from the performance
  file.
- {py:attr}`apu <AEIC.performance.models.BasePerformanceModel.apu>`:
  auxiliary-power-unit properties resolved from `engines/APU_data.toml` using
  the `apu_name` specified in the performance file.
- {py:attr}`speeds <AEIC.performance.models.BasePerformanceModel.speeds>`:
  cruise speed data.
