# Performance model files

Performance model files are TOML files containing data to define an aircraft
performance model. Different performance model types are supported, and are
distinguished by a top-level `model_type` field, with one of the following
values:

 * `model_type = "legacy"`: legacy table-based performance model, intended to
   replicate the behavior of the AEIC v2 Matlab code. These files are
   essentially just a conversion of BADA PTF files into TOML format, including
   some extra information from the engine database.
 * `model_type = "bada"`: BADA3-based performance model.
 * `model_type = "tasopt"`: performance model based on TASOPT simulations.

```{note}
So far, only the legacy performance model is implemented.
```

## Creating performance model files

There is a {command}`make-performance-model` command to help with the creation
of performance model TOML files.

```{warning}
Currently, this can obviously only generate "legacy" performance model files!
A `tasopt` subcommand is also registered (`aeic make-performance-model
tasopt ...`) but is a stub that currently raises `NotImplementedError`.

Also, the script is unfinished and needs some work by Adi and/or Wyatt to pin
down some of the choices for generating the performance table and LTO data.
```

A complete invocation of {command}`make-performance-model` to generate a
legacy performance model file looks like this:

```shell
aeic make-performance-model \
  --output-file tmp.toml \
  legacy \
  --apu-name 'APU 131-9' \
  --number-of-engines 2 \
  --aircraft-class narrow \
  --maximum-payload 22422 \
  --ptf-file /home/bada/B738__.PTF \
  --lto-source edb \
  --engine-file engines/sample_edb.xlsx \
  --engine-uid 01P11CM121
```

Performance data is taken from a BADA PTF file, and LTO data is taken from the
engine database.

(More documentation to come when this is finished.)

## Example file

The following shows an example performance model file, for a legacy
table-based performance model. The fields common to all performance models
(defined in the {py:class}`BasePerformanceModel
<AEIC.performance.models.BasePerformanceModel>` class) come first, then the
fields specific to the {py:class}`LegacyPerformanceModel
<AEIC.performance.models.LegacyPerformanceModel>` class. In this case, the
model type-specific fields are a table of performance data that the model
uses.

All of the common fields are defined as simple attributes on the
{py:class}`BasePerformanceModel
<AEIC.performance.models.BasePerformanceModel>` class and are interpreted
according to the usual rules for fields in Pydantic models. In particular, the
`speeds` and `LTO_performance` tables within the TOML data define dictionaries
mapping from flight phases to speed and performance data. The fields and
sub-types for these entries can be seen by following the types from the
{py:attr}`speeds <AEIC.performance.models.BasePerformanceModel.speeds>` and
{py:attr}`lto_performance
<AEIC.performance.models.BasePerformanceModel.lto_performance>` fields of the
{py:class}`BasePerformanceModel
<AEIC.performance.models.BasePerformanceModel>` class.
