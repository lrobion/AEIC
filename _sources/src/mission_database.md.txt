# Mission database

The {py:class}`Database <AEIC.missions.Database>`, {py:class}`Query
<AEIC.missions.Query>` and {py:class}`Filter <AEIC.missions.Filter>` classes
in the `AEIC.missions` package give access to flight schedule data for mission
planning. Currently this is primarily intended for use with OAG data converted
from CSV files. The database files use a schema optimized for the query
patterns used in AEIC. This optimization is important because the flight
schedule data tends to contain a large number of records, and we want to be
able to filter them in several different ways.

To understand the way the database is organized, it helps to distinguish
between **flights** and **flight instances**. A **flight instance** is a
single flight between an origin and a destination airport departing at a given
time on a given date. A **flight** represents a sequence of **flight
instances** by defining a schedule of days of the week and departure time
between a pair of effective dates. A **flight** corresponds to a single row in
an input OAG CSV file, and each **flight** may have multiple **flight
instances**. The **flight instances** are reified in the SQLite database to
make querying the schedule of flights more efficient.

## Usage example

Here's a basic usage example to give an idea of how the API works:

```python
from AEIC import missions

# Open the database.
db = missions.Database('oag-2019.sqlite')

# Build a scheduled flight query.
query = missions.Query(
    # Filter on flight characteristics.
    filter=missions.Filter(
        # Flight distance between 9500 and 10000 kilometers.
        min_distance=9500,
        max_distance=10000,
        # Seat capacity >= 500.
        min_seat_capacity=500,
        # Flight origin or destination in US or Canada.
        country=['US', 'CA'],
    )
)

# Iterate over the flight results: there are only 46 from this query...
for flight in db(query):
    # ... so it's practical just to print some data.
    print(flight.departure.isoformat(), flight.carrier + flight.flight_number)
```

## Reference documentation

The main classes of interest in the API are:

- {py:class}`Database <AEIC.missions.Database>`: the main database class;
- {py:class}`Query <AEIC.missions.Query>`: a query that returns a sequence of
  **flight instances** as {py:class}`Mission <AEIC.missions.Mission>`
  objects;
- {py:class}`FrequentFlightQuery <AEIC.missions.FrequentFlightQuery>`: a query
  that returns most frequent origin/destination pairs appearing in **flight
  instances**;
- {py:class}`FrequentFlightQueryResult
  <AEIC.missions.query.FrequentFlightQueryResult>`: a single result from an
  {py:class}`FrequentFlightQuery <AEIC.missions.FrequentFlightQuery>` query;
- {py:class}`CountQuery <AEIC.missions.CountQuery>`: a query that counts
  **flight instances** matching given conditions;
- {py:class}`TimeRangeQuery <AEIC.missions.TimeRangeQuery>`: a query that
  returns the earliest and latest scheduled departure timestamps matching
  the filter conditions;
- {py:class}`Filter <AEIC.missions.Filter>`: a filter on **flight** characteristics usable with all query
  types.

### Database class

The {py:class}`AEIC.missions.Database` class is a wrapper around a connection
to an SQLite database file (using the Python standard library's
[`sqlite3`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html) package). The
{py:class}`Database <AEIC.missions.Database>` class hides the details of both
the database structure and the underlying SQL interface to SQLite, instead
exposing a simple application-specific query API.

The {py:class}`Database <AEIC.missions.Database>` class is oriented towards
read-only access to a mission database. AEIC also ships a derived class,
{py:class}`WritableDatabase
<AEIC.missions.writable_database.WritableDatabase>`, which is used internally
(primarily by `aeic convert-oag-data`) to construct new flight databases.
It is not part of the public API and should not be relied on from user
code.

The normal workflow for querying the mission database is to create a
{py:class}`Database <AEIC.missions.Database>` instance, passing the path to
the SQLite database file to the constructor:

```python
db = AEIC.missions.Database('oag-2019.sqlite')
```

The {py:class}`Database <AEIC.missions.Database>` object is callable, and when
you call it with query objects (see below), it returns a Python
[generator](https://realpython.com/introduction-to-python-generators/) that
you can iterate over to get individual results:

```python
for flight in db(AEIC.missions.Query()):
    print(flight.carrier + flight.flight_id)
```

(Don't try to run this code! It will iterate through *every* **flight
instance** in the database in departure time order. An empty {py:class}`Query
<AEIC.missions.Query>` selects all **flight instances**.)

```{eval-rst}
.. autoclass:: AEIC.missions.Database
   :special-members: __init__, __call__
```

### Queries

Database queries come in four flavors. **Flight instance** queries,
represented by the {py:class}`AEIC.missions.Query` class, return **flight
instances** in departure time order, filtered by various criteria. Frequent
flight queries, represented by the
{py:class}`AEIC.missions.FrequentFlightQuery` class, return pairs of origin
and destination airports that have the most flights between them, again
filtered by various criteria. Count queries, represented by the
{py:class}`AEIC.missions.CountQuery` class, count the number of **flight
instances** that match given conditions. Time-range queries, represented
by the {py:class}`AEIC.missions.TimeRangeQuery` class, return the
minimum and maximum scheduled departure timestamps matching the filter
conditions.

The filtering criteria for the different query types share some features in
common, so the query classes are derived from a {py:class}`QueryBase
<AEIC.missions.query.QueryBase>` base class. Each of the query classes has a
{py:attr}`RESULT_TYPE <AEIC.missions.query.QueryBase.RESULT_TYPE>` member that
gives the type of the results returned when you run one of these queries.

#### Base query class

The base query class includes filter parameters for the **flight instance**
start and end dates to consider, as well as an
{py:class}`AEIC.missions.Filter` value that filters on **flight**
characteristics (like origin and destination, distance, etc.).

```{eval-rst}
.. autoclass:: AEIC.missions.query.QueryBase
   :inherited-members: filter, start_date, end_date
   :exclude-members: to_sql
```

#### Scheduled flight queries

The {py:class}`AEIC.missions.Query` class returns individual **flight
instances** in departure time order, corresponding to a given set of filter
conditions. This query type supports **flight** characteristics filtering
(using {py:class}`AEIC.missions.Filter`), start and end date filtering (from
{py:class}`AEIC.missions.QueryBase`) and random and "every nth day"
sub-sampling (using the `sample` and `every_nth` parameters).

These queries return results as a generator of
{py:class}`AEIC.missions.Mission` instances, populated with all of the
known information about the corresponding **flight instances**.

The following examples illustrate some uses of
{py:class}`AEIC.missions.Query`.

Return all **flight instances** for all **flights** with a distance between
1000 and 5000 kilometers:

```python
q = AEIC.missions.Query(
    filter=AEIC.missions.Filter(min_distance=1000, max_distance=5000)
)
```

Return a random 5% sample of **flight instances** for all flights between
France and China:

```python
q = AEIC.missions.Query(filter=AEIC.missions.Filter(country=['FR', 'CN']), sample=0.05)
```

Return all 787 **flight instances** from France to China departing every 8th
day starting on March 1 2019:

```python
q = AEIC.missions.Query(
    filter=AEIC.missions.Filter(
        origin_country='FR', destination_country='CN', aircraft_type='787'
    ),
    start_date=date(2019, 3, 1),
    every_nth=8,
)
```

```{eval-rst}
.. autoclass:: AEIC.missions.Query
   :members: every_nth, sample, limit, offset, RESULT_TYPE
   :exclude-members: to_sql
```

#### Frequent flights queries

The {py:class}`AEIC.missions.FrequentFlightQuery` class returns airport pairs
(discounting the direction, i.e., BOS → LHR is the same as LHR → BOS) and
counts of flights between them matching a given filter condition. The filter
conditions supported are the same as for **flight instance** queries, i.e.
represented by an {py:class}`AEIC.missions.Filter` instance. Results are
returned as a generator of
{py:class}`AEIC.missions.query.FrequentFlightQueryResult` values, which
contain the airport codes and a count of the number of **flight instances**.

For example, if we want to find the ten most common routes flown by 787s, we
can do:

```python
>>> from AEIC import missions
>>> db = AEIC.missions.Database('oag-2019.sqlite')
>>> q = AEIC.missions.FrequentFlightQuery(filter=AEIC.missions.Filter(aircraft_type='787'), limit=10)
>>> for f in db(q):
>>>     print(f.airport1, f.airport2, f.number_of_flights)
```

with output

```

```{eval-rst}
.. autoclass:: AEIC.missions.FrequentFlightQuery
   :members: limit, RESULT_TYPE
   :exclude-members: to_sql
```

```{eval-rst}
.. autoclass:: AEIC.missions.query.FrequentFlightQueryResult
   :members:
   :exclude-members: from_row
```

#### Count queries

Sometimes we just want a count of the number of **flight instances** matching
a filter. For example, before running some long computation on each **flight
instance**, it's useful to know if there are millions of them... Running an
{py:class}`AEIC.missions.CountQuery` query returns a single integer count
value, i.e., there is no generator involved.

For example, if we want to count the total number of 777 **flight instances**
in the database, we can do:

```python
>>> from AEIC import missions
>>> db = AEIC.missions.Database('oag-2019.sqlite')
>>> db(AEIC.missions.CountQuery(filter=AEIC.missions.Filter(aircraft_type='777')))
108906
```

```{eval-rst}
.. autoclass:: AEIC.missions.CountQuery
   :members: RESULT_TYPE
   :exclude-members: to_sql
```

#### Time-range queries

The {py:class}`AEIC.missions.TimeRangeQuery` class returns a single
`(min_ts, max_ts)` tuple of Unix epoch seconds (UTC) covering the
scheduled departure timestamps matching the filter conditions. Both
values are `None` if no flight instances match. This is useful for
discovering the date range of a mission database without iterating
every row.

```python
>>> from AEIC import missions
>>> db = missions.Database('oag-2019.sqlite')
>>> db(missions.TimeRangeQuery())
(1546300800, 1577750400)
```

```{eval-rst}
.. autoclass:: AEIC.missions.TimeRangeQuery
   :members: RESULT_TYPE
   :exclude-members: to_sql
```

### Filters

```{eval-rst}
.. autoclass:: AEIC.missions.Filter
   :members:
   :exclude-members: to_sql
```

## Database schema

The database schema for the mission database is described [on the GitHub
wiki](https://github.com/MIT-LAE/AEIC/wiki/OAG-database) for AEIC. (The wiki
page is slightly outdated: the definitive documentation for the database
schema is the {py:attr}`_ensure_schema` method of the
{py:class}`AEIC.missions.writable_database.WritableDatabase` class.)
