Welcome to AEIC's documentation!
================================

The **Aviation Emissions Inventory Tool** (``AEIC``) is a Python library for
modelling and aggregating global aviation emissions over time. Based on a
previous version made using ``MATLAB`` by Simone et al. (found `here
<https://zenodo.org/records/6461767>`_), this updated library seeks to migrate
the MATLAB functionality to Python and add support for previously unsupported
performance models, updated trajectory dynamics, parallelization, and more.
